** TODO Language server integration

I have it working in my Emacs Doom config, but it has doom specific code there (modules). Shall I port it here?

Also, Emacs 29 comes with an LSP client called Eglot built in. But I'm using lsp-mode installed from straight.

** STRT Syntax highlighting

Partially done.
